Impact of training on employee performance based on employee perception
Objectives:
1. To find the influence between the factors leading to training effectiveness
2. To find the impact of training on employee performance

Abstract:
This research aims at identifying the impact of training on employee performance. This study explored the factors that effect training program such as training delivery, training transfer, employee motivation. A quantitative analysis was carried out where in a questionnaire was distributed to employees who underwent training, to understand the influence of training program on employee performance. The study reveals that there exists an interplay between the factors training delivery, training transfer, employee motivation as well as training has an influence on employee performance.

Factors:
Training delivery
Training transfer
Employee motivation

Dependent variable:
Employee performance

The equation obtained after regression is 
Y=  -0.0346(TT3)+  0.2655 (TD8) +  0.0529 (TD4) + 0.1025 (TT5)+  0.6979 (EM3) -0.1230 (EM1)    


The above equation explains that 

-> Decrease in TT3 will decrease performance
When an employee does not use what he/she learned in the training , it reflects on their performance

-> Increase in TD8 will increase performance
Employees perform better if they are updated with new techniques and technology related to their work

-> Increase in TD4 will increase performance
If proper time is allotted for a tainng program then employees learn better and training transfer takes place at an increaded rate leading to increased performance

-> Increase in TT5 will increase performance
With proper support from peers , an individual can easily implement the learning from the training on the job

-> Increase in EM3 will increase performance
When an employee takes an initiative to attend a training program , he/she is willing to learn and experiment leading to better performance

-> Decrease in EM1 will decrease performance
If management does not include the trainees while deciding the content course they may be demotivated to attend the training program which hinders performance

Inference:(What needs to be taken care of by the organization)
1.Topics covered in the training should be up to date with the recent technology(technical trainings)
2.Appropriate time must be allotted for the training ( A course which demands 12 hrs should be given 12 hours rather than trying to complete it in 8-10 hrs)
3.Peers must support their fellow colleagues in implementing anyhing new learned in the training
4.Management should include tainees while deciding the content of the course so that they are aware of what they will be dealing with in the training program
